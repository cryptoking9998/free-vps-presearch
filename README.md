This is a list of providers that offer Free or great trial options for a Virtual Private Servers (VPS) that can be used for various purposes. I started this when I am looking for either free or cost effective options to run a [**Node**](https://nodes.presearch.org/) for [Presearch](https://presearch.org), A decentralized search engine that rewards community for running nodes and searching and protects your privacy at the same time.

If you are interested to be part of Presearch, feel free to create an account using my [referral link](https://presearch.org/signup?rid=2073260).
